The actual contract\r\n                for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. eBay is not a traditional\r\n                auctioneer.\r\n\r\n                Any guidance we provide as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing,\r\n                and sourcing is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also,\r\n                while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs,\r\n                eBay has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or\r\n                legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings;\r\n                the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or\r\n                that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\">3.

Fees and Taxes</p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n                The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our Selling fees pages.\r\n                We may change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay\r\n                site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions\r\n                or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.\r\n\r\n                If you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made\r\n                using some or all of our Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made\r\n                outside of eBay. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or\r\n                ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside\r\n                of eBay, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if\r\n                the item doesn't sell, given your usage of our Services for the introduction to a buyer.\r\n\r\n                You must have a payment method on file when selling through our Services and pay all\r\n                fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date.\r\n                If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect amounts\r\n                owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retain collection agencies\r\n                and legal counsel, suspend or limit Services, and for accounts over 60 days past\r\n                due, request that PayPal deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account balance.\r\n                In addition, you will be subject to late fees. eBay, or the collection agencies we\r\n                retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a\r\n                result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be\r\n                reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported\r\n                to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at\r\n                eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729.\r\n                If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit\r\n                bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly.\r\n\r\n                In any jurisdiction where eBay has an obligation to collect sales taxes on sales you\r\n                make using our Services, we may collect such sales taxes from you via the payment\r\n                method on file under the terms of the Billing Agreement or via any other means available to us.\r\n\r\n                Seller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on our Services.\r\n                We may display third-party advertisements (including links and references thereto)\r\n                or other content in any part of our Services, in our sole discretion and without\r\n                consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other credit to, sellers.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\">6. Listing Conditions</p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n                When listing an item for sale on our Services, you agree to comply \r\n                with eBay's Listing policies and Selling practices policy and that:\r\n\r\n                You assume full responsibility for the item offered and the accuracy \r\n                and content of the listing,\r\n                Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category \r\n                for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). eBay can't \r\n                guarantee exact listing duration,\r\n                Your fixed-price listings may renew automatically every calendar month, \r\n                based on the listing terms at the time, until all quantities sell or the \r\n                listing is ended by you or eBay, in its sole discretion,\r\n                Content that violates any of eBay's policies may be modified, obfuscated \r\n                or deleted at eBay's sole discretion,\r\n                We may revise product data associated with listings to supplement, remove, \r\n                or correct information,\r\n                We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking \r\n                for. Therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and \r\n                browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\r\n                buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history;\r\n                item's location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query;\r\n                seller's history, including listing practices, Detailed Seller Ratings, eBay policy compliance, Feedback, and defect rate; and\r\n                number of listings matching the buyer's query,\r\n                To drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer,\r\n                Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on some of our Services,\r\n                eBay's Duplicate listings Policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results,\r\n                Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered so as to not affect third-party search engine results,\r\n                We may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your listings. Such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales and performance history of similar sold and current listings; results may vary for individual listings. To drive the recommendations experience, you agree that we may display the sales and performance history of your individual listings to other sellers,\r\n                For items listed in certain categories, subject to certain programs, and/or offered or sold at certain price points, eBay may require the use of certain payment methods, subject to our Payments methods policy. For example, for inventory covered by authentication services, buyer and sellers may be subject to escrow, screening, shipping, and/or payment handling requirements.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\"></p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\"></p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\"></p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\"></p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default UserAgreement;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
