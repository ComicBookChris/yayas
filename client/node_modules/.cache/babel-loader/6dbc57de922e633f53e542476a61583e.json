To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, eBay may respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or international shipping). Sellers pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program. Pursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and Foreign Trade Regulations, the buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc. acting as your buyer's forwarding agent.

About eBay</p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n                eBay is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell and buy just about\r\n                anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations. The actual contract\r\n                for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. eBay is not a traditional\r\n                auctioneer.\r\n\r\n                Any guidance we provide as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing,\r\n                and sourcing is solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also,\r\n                while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs,\r\n                eBay has no control over and does not guarantee: the existence, quality, safety or\r\n                legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings;\r\n                the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or\r\n                that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\">3.

Fees and Taxes</p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n                The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our Selling fees pages.\r\n                We may change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay\r\n                site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions\r\n                or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.\r\n\r\n                If you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made\r\n                using some or all of our Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made\r\n                outside of eBay.

If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported\r\n                to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at\r\n                eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729.\r\n                If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit\r\n                bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly.\r\n\r\n                In any jurisdiction where eBay has an obligation to collect sales taxes on sales you\r\n                make using our Services, we may collect such sales taxes from you via the payment\r\n                method on file under the terms of the Billing Agreement or via any other means available to us.\r\n\r\n                Seller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on our Services.\r\n                We may display third-party advertisements (including links and references thereto)\r\n                or other content in any part of our Services, in our sole discretion and without\r\n                consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other credit to, sellers.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\">6. Listing Conditions</p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n                When listing an item for sale on our Services, you agree to comply\r\n                with eBay's Listing policies and Selling practices policy and that:\r\n\r\n                You assume full responsibility for the item offered and the accuracy\r\n                and content of the listing,\r\n                Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category\r\n                for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances). eBay can't\r\n                guarantee exact listing duration,\r\n                Your fixed-price listings may renew automatically every calendar month,\r\n                based on the listing terms at the time, until all quantities sell or the\r\n                listing is ended by you or eBay, in its sole discretion,\r\n                Content that violates any of eBay's policies may be modified, obfuscated\r\n                or deleted at eBay's sole discretion,\r\n                We may revise product data associated with listings to supplement, remove,\r\n                or correct information,\r\n                We strive to create a marketplace where buyers find what they are looking\r\n                for. Therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and\r\n                browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\r\n                buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history;\r\n                item's location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service,\r\n                end time, history, and relevance to the user query;\r\n                seller's history, including listing practices, Detailed Seller Ratings,\r\n                eBay policy compliance, Feedback, and defect rate; and\r\n                number of listings matching the buyer's query,\r\n                To drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some\r\n                search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer,\r\n                Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on some of our Services,\r\n                eBay's Duplicate listings Policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results,\r\n                Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered\r\n                so as to not affect third-party search engine results,\r\n                We may provide you with optional recommendations to consider when creating your\r\n                listings. Such recommendations may be based on the aggregated sales and performance\r\n                history of similar sold and current listings; results may vary for individual\r\n                listings. To drive the recommendations experience, you agree that we may display\r\n                the sales and performance history of your individual listings to other sellers,\r\n                For items listed in certain categories, subject to certain programs, and/or\r\n                offered or sold at certain price points, eBay may require the use of certain\r\n                payment methods, subject to our Payments methods policy. For example, for\r\n                inventory covered by authentication services, buyer and sellers may be subject\r\n                to escrow, screening, shipping, and/or payment handling requirements.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\">7. Purchase Conditions</p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n                When buying an item on our Services, you agree to the Rules and policies for buyers and that:\r\n\r\n                You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or committing to buy,\r\n                You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item, \r\n                your offer for an item is accepted, or if you have the winning bid (or your bid is otherwise \r\n                accepted),\r\n                For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction \r\n                representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does \r\n                not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller,\r\n                We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer,\r\n                Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) apply to the \r\n                transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller \r\n                agree otherwise.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\">8. International Buying and Selling; Translation</p>\r\n            <p className=\"text-center\">\r\n            Many of our Services are accessible internationally. We may offer certain programs, \r\n            tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, \r\n            such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. \r\n            \r\n            Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable \r\n            to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.\r\n\r\n            If you purchase an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, \r\n            you are subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies of that other eBay site \r\n            with respect to that particular purchase, as detailed in the International Selling Policy.\r\n\r\n            For sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an eBay site other \r\n            \r\n            than the site where you listed your item for sale, based on your shipping settings. \r\n            You may adjust these settings as detailed in the International Selling Policy. \r\n            If you list your items with an international shipping option, the appearance of your \r\n            listings on sites other than the listing site is not guaranteed. If you sell an item \r\n            on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, you are subject to the \r\n            User Agreement and applicable policies, including any buyer protection programs, of \r\n            that other eBay site with respect to that particular sale, as detailed in the \r\n            International Selling Policy.\r\n\r\n            You authorize us to use automated tools to translate your eBay content and member-to-member\r\n            communications, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions\r\n            are available. We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content\r\n            at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.\r\n\r\n            One of the ways that we may make eBay.com listings available to international buyers on\r\n            eBay.com and on eBay's international sites is through the Global Shipping Program. For eligible items located in the United States and purchased by an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States after receiving notification of payment from the buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global shipping provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, eBay may respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or international shipping). Sellers pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program.\r\n\r\n            Pursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations\r\n            and Foreign Trade Regulations, the buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest,\r\n            will agree to assume responsibility for the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc.\r\n            acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. You remain liable for the accuracy of information you \r\n            provide about items, and you agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional \r\n            information.\r\n\r\n            You consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information, as well as \r\n            listing and order information, by eBay to Pitney Bowes Inc., and by Pitney Bowes Inc. \r\n            to its affiliates, service providers, and other third parties (such as customs and \r\n            revenue authorities, as well as other government agencies), in connection with the \r\n            processing, export and customs clearance, and international transportation of any item. \r\n            eBay does not control the privacy policies of Pitney Bowes Inc., its affiliates, or its \r\n            service providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as applicable.\r\n\r\n            Additional information about the program, including policies governing feedback, \r\n            the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution \r\n            of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program, can be found\r\n            on our Global Shipping Program and Global Shipping FAQs pages.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"text-center text-bold\">9.
