You and Yayas Island Mart agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and Yayas Island Mart (or any related third parties) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of Yayas Island Mart or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section. A. Applicable Law You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Yayas Island Mart, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement. B. Agreement to Arbitrate You and Yayas Island Mart each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and Yayas Island Mart (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to our Services, the actions of Yayas Island Mart or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief YOU AND Yayas Island Mart AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Yayas Island Mart AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and Yayas Island Mart's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated. Arbitration Procedures Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\\\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\\\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\\\"AAA\\\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA\\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or the court. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (\\\"Notice\\\"). The Notice to Yayas Island Mart must be sent to Yayas Island Mart, Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. Yayas Island Mart Way, Draper, UT 84020. Yayas Island Mart will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your Yayas Island Mart account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account. If you and Yayas Island Mart are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after Yayas Island Mart receives that Notice, you or Yayas Island Mart may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to Yayas Island Mart at the following address: Yayas Island Mart, 1100 N La Brea Ave, Inglewood, CA 90302, United States; In the event Yayas Island Mart initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your Yayas Island Mart account. Any settlement offer made by you or Yayas Island Mart shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Yayas Island Mart may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Yayas Island Mart user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Costs of Arbitration Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement (\\\"Arbitration Procedures\\\") and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Yayas Island Mart will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by Yayas Island Mart should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and Yayas Island Mart will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Yayas Island Mart for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Yayas Island Mart on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules. Severability With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\\\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\\\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.

IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW \r\n            CLAIMS YOU AND Yayas Island Mart HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.\r\n\r\n            In this Legal Disputes Section, the term “related third parties” includes your and Yayas Island Mart’s respective \r\n            affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, predecessors, successors, assigns, as well as your, Yayas Island Mart’s, \r\n            and these entities’ respective employees and agents.\r\n\r\n            You and Yayas Island Mart agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you \r\n            and Yayas Island Mart (or any related third parties) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous \r\n            versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of Yayas Island Mart or its agents, \r\n            or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the \r\n            provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.\r\n\r\n            A. Applicable Law\r\n            You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of \r\n            Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or \r\n            dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Yayas Island Mart, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.\r\n\r\n            B. Agreement to Arbitrate\r\n            You and Yayas Island Mart each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and \r\n            Yayas Island Mart (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of \r\n            the User Agreement, your use of or access to our Services, the actions of Yayas Island Mart or its agents, or any products \r\n            or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and \r\n            binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, \r\n            if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual \r\n            (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement \r\n            of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\r\n\r\n            Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\r\n            YOU AND Yayas Island Mart AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT \r\n            AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION \r\n            OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Yayas Island Mart AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE \r\n            THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, \r\n            REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY \r\n            AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL \r\n            PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S \r\n            INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable \r\n            law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim or a particular \r\n            request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and \r\n            only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, \r\n            subject to your and Yayas Island Mart's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\r\n\r\n            Arbitration Procedures\r\n            Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a \r\n            judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award \r\n            the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator \r\n            should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, \r\n            except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or \r\n            the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative \r\n            Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\r\n\r\n            The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, \r\n            including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (as applicable), \r\n            as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. In the event that \r\n            the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties \r\n            or the court.\r\n\r\n            A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of \r\n            Dispute (\"Notice\"). The Notice to Yayas Island Mart must be sent to Yayas Island Mart, \r\n            Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. Yayas Island Mart Way, Draper, UT 84020. Yayas Island Mart will send any \r\n            Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your Yayas Island Mart account; it is your responsibility \r\n            to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all \r\n            information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, \r\n            the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.\r\n\r\n            If you and Yayas Island Mart are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after Yayas Island Mart receives \r\n            that Notice, you or Yayas Island Mart may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings \r\n            is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with \r\n            its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the \r\n            opposing party. You may send a copy to Yayas Island Mart at the following address: Yayas Island Mart,\r\n                1100 N La Brea Ave, Inglewood, CA 90302, United States; In the event Yayas Island Mart initiates an arbitration against you, it will send \r\n            a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your Yayas Island Mart account. Any \r\n            settlement offer made by you or Yayas Island Mart shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\r\n\r\n            The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. \r\n            Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of \r\n            documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances \r\n            warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Yayas Island Mart may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator \r\n            requires otherwise.\r\n\r\n            The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized \r\n            principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound \r\n            by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving \r\n            the same Yayas Island Mart user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and \r\n            judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\r\n\r\n            Costs of Arbitration\r\n            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise \r\n            stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this \r\n            Agreement (\"Arbitration Procedures\") and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Yayas Island Mart \r\n            will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by \r\n            Yayas Island Mart should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and Yayas Island Mart will make arrangements to \r\n            pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you \r\n            assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Yayas Island Mart for all fees associated with the arbitration \r\n            paid by Yayas Island Mart on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.\r\n\r\n            Severability\r\n            With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and \r\n            Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement \r\n            to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\r\n\r\n            Opt-Out Procedure\r\n            IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT-OUT\") BY MAILING US A \r\n            WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\").
